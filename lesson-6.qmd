## My title 

_This_is_italic_ and this is not

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: true
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)

smaller <- diamonds |> 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about about **diamonds** are larger than 2.5 carats.
The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

```{r}
#| label: plot-smaller-diamonds
#| echo: false

# Calculating smaller bc we care about xyz
smaller |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)
```
